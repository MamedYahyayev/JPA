    1) Table Per Hierarchy
	Let's say we have a Persons: Employee and Student and each these classes have own specific property , but i don't wanna create
	a table for each classes. I want to create table like this I create a new Class and this class holds same properties for Employee
	and Student for doing this, i create Person class and let's assume we have id , name , surname properties which are the same
	in the Student and Employee. I create Person class and add these above properties after that create Employee class
	add salary property and then create Student class, add course property that it. And  also  these classes have to extend Person class.
	All these stuff Hibernate ( Jpa ) create a table which name is Person.
	In this table we have these columns : id , name , surname ,salary , course furthermore we have DType column what is this.
	This column shows the Person, that means this person is either an employee, or a student, or a person. And this is table.

	DType       Id  Name    Surname     Salary  Course
	person	    1	Samir	Samirov
    employee	2	Kazim	Kazimov	    1200
    student	    3	Famil	Familov		           2

    Also we have an additional annotation: @DiscriminatorValue what is this how we can use it. okay this annotations define the DType
    value that means if we don't define this annotation DType take the class names by default. If we don't want this
    we add @DiscriminatorValue and give the name whatever you want to see on the table.

    2) Table Per Hierarchy using Annotation
    We can use annotation to configure Table per Hierarchy. @Inheritance annotation allow us to create this inheritance type.
    For creating this type of inheritance add this annotation to Parent class or Base class. This is Person in our example.
    @Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE) add this annotation , in addition we have to define DType column name with
    @DiscriminatorColumn(name = "type", discriminatorType = DiscriminatorType.STRING) also we can replace the string type with Integer
    or Char type if we want.

    3) Table per Concrete
    Hibernate generate table for each classes in this type of inheritance. So we have Person , Employee , Student table and this tables
    have same properties. We use 2 annotation for creating this type of inheritance. First of them is @Inheritance and the other one
    is @AttributeOverrides. Let's create this inheritance. First of all add @Inheritance annotation to Parent which is parent class in Java.
    and add this @Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS) This annotation allows us to create a table
    for each class that inherits this class. Not finished , in addition we have to add another annotation, this is @AttributeOverrides.
    This class define properties which is in the Person class. And override that properties. Like this:
    @AttributeOverrides({
            @AttributeOverride(name = "id", column = @Column(name = "id")),
            @AttributeOverride(name = "name", column = @Column(name = "name")),
            @AttributeOverride(name = "surname", column = @Column(name = "surname"))
    })
    You see this annotation create table with these properties: id , name ,surname and properties which is own.

    Result:
    **************************************************
    Person class:
    Id      Name        Surname
    1       Kazim       Kazimov

    Employee class:
    Id      Name        Surname     Salary
    1       Camal       Camalov     1200

    Student class:
    Id      Name        Surname     Course
    1       Sabir       Sabirov     2
    **************************************************

    4) Table Per Subclass
     I give you brief example. Add @Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED) and next add @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name = "person_id")
     to the class that inherits Person class. Result is this:

     Result:
     **************************************************
     Person class:
     Id      Name        Surname
     1       Kazim       Kazimov
     2       Camal       Camalov
     3       Sabir       Sabirov

     Employee class:
     Salary     Person_Id
     1200       2

     Student class:
     Course     Person_Id
     2          3
     **************************************************

    -   @MapKeyColumn
     Okay let's suppose we want to create Employee table and this employee has own map collection for example employee_items map.
     If we want to create a new table contains of employee_items we need to add @ElementCollection to Map property. After that we can
     give the any name we want , in this case i want to give employee_items name to newly created table , Okay now this table contains
     3 column the first one is foreign key this column take reference from employee id inside of employee table , if we don't give the name this fk
     and this id takes reference table name by default. If we want to give the name we add following annotation
     @CollectionTable(name = "employee_items", joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "emp_id" , referencedColumnName = "id"))
     This annotation define table name and foreign key name and its reference. Now the turn is items.
      Now i want to call key and value columns with different name. We can gave Key name with @MapKeyColumn annotation as shown below.
     @MapKeyColumn(name = "items_name").
     If i want to give the name to value of Map we can use @Column(name = "quantity") annotation.


     -  @SequenceGenerator
     Use cases:
        @Id
        @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE , generator = "jpa_sequence")
        @SequenceGenerator(name = "jpa_sequence", initialValue = 5)
        private Long id;


     Auditing in JPA
     First of all we have to  create Audit class and implement 3 methods ( PrePersist , PreUpdate , PreRemove ) in this class,
     after that add @EntityListener(AuditClass.class) annotation to the class which we write the logs before audit operations
     in our case we create FamilyMembers entity class and add @EntityListener(AuditingEntity.class) annotation , after that we create
     new class what this class write logs to the file (log.txt)  like this format OPERATION -- TIME , that's all.

     Auditing in Hibernate with Envers
     Add hibernate envers dependency to pom file to configure audit in hibernate , after that just add @Audited annotation
     to above of the class which you want to audit. And hibernate generate table what name is entity_name + '_AUX'.
     and in this table you have 2 default column. One of them is rev and the other is rev_type.
     What are those?. The first one if foreign key of revinfo table and also this table was generated default by hibernate.
     And this table holds 2 column id and timestamp. What is rev_type
     if we do persist operation on the table this type will be 0, for update will be 1 and for remove will be 2

     AuditReader
     This interface helps us to read audit from table for Class. For Example in our case we have Tax table and it's
     tax_aud table if we want to read data from this table we can use AuditReader interface. Let's create simple example to demonstrate

     AuditReader reader = AuditReaderFactory.get(entityManager); // this method takes object of EntityManager
     AuditQuery query = reader.createQuery().forEntitiesAtRevision(Tax.class, 1); // what is revision revision is these (persist - 0, update - 1, remove - 2)
     // the above line takes rows for revision number and create query , also we can write complex query such as retrieve the audit log
     // which the column name is '..'
     // and to see the result , we call getResultList() method
     System.out.println(query.getResultList());

     Another example
     List personsAtAddress = getAuditReader().createQuery()
         .forEntitiesAtRevision(Person.class, 12)
         .addOrder(AuditEntity.property("surname").desc())
         .add(AuditEntity.relatedId("address").eq(addressId))
         .setFirstResult(4)
         .setMaxResults(2)
         .getResultList();
